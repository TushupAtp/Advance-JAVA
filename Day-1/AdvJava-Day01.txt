web server
ftp server
database server
mail (smtp/pop3) server


suppose i need a website of my own, for ex: majrul.com

1.  i need a web server which will be runing 24*7
    -> this server needs a static ip and DNS mapped to it 
    -> since investing in a server is expensive, we use a business model
       called as Web Hosting
    -> also now a days we are using another business model for running
       web applications called as cloud computing (aws/azure/gcp)

a website is made up of client side as well as server side code:
   -> client side code is made up of HTML, CSS and JS
   -> server side code is made up of technologies like Servlet/JSP/ASP/PHP, ...


examples of web servers:
Apache Web Server
Microsoft IIS
Nginx

The above 3 popular web servers don't support Java technology directly

But through a server side extension, we can enable support for Java technology
These server side extensions are traditionally called as Web containers, for ex:
Apache Tomcat
JBoss
Weblogic
Websphere
Glassfish

These web containers have all the features present in a Web server, but additionally
they support Java technology (Servlet/JSP)

So it's also possible that we don't use a separate web server in our setup, for ex:
we can install Tomcat and use it like a web server too
But in live applications, a server + container combination is generally used

for ex:
apache web server + apache tomcat
microsoft iis + apache tomcat
nginx + apache tomcat

in large enterprises, multiple technologies are used:
-> the home loan application maybe developed using java tech
-> the car loan application maybe developed using python tech

TODO:
1. role of web/http server
2. difference between web server and web container
3. what is the role of servlet/jsp
4. what are the steps to write and run a servlet program
5. what is genericservlet, httpservlet, doGet/doPost, ...
6. what is request/response style web development
7. what is role of http protocol
8. what are the various methods of http protocol (get/post/...)
