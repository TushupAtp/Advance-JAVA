hello.jsp
==========
<html><body>
Today's Date is <%= new Date() %>
</body></html>

What we have understood is:
- JSP get's translated into a Servlet in the background, 
  which is then compiled and loaded to generate the response
- In the generated Servlet, whatever code we write in a JSP get's copied into a method by the name
  _jspService(...)
  
  The generated Servlet for the above code might look like this:
  public class hello_jsp extends HttpServlet {
    
    public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
      response.setContentType("text/html");
      JspWriter out = response.getWriter();
      out.write("<html><body>");
      out.write("Today's Date is " + new Date());
      out.write("</body></html>");
    }    
  }
