there are two types of streams:
1. binary streams
2. character streams

binary streams
- reading/writing binary data

character streams
- reading/writing character data

java.io provides support for both the types of streams:
for ex:
 FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, .... (binary) 
 -> jpg, pdf, doc, mp3, mp4, .......
 FileReader, FileWriter, ... (char)
 -> txt, html, xml, json, ...

TODO:
Design one form which will take two numbers as an input. 
Then write a servlet will read those numbers, add/sub them and display the result.

Design one login form which will take username and password as input.
Then write a servlet which will read the same and perform the following cases:
- if the user is a valid user, show a welcome message
- if the user is an invalid user, show an error message

for the time being hardcode the username/password in the servlet for valid user:
- if(username.equals("majrul") && password.equals("123"))
